PSXGameEdit/PSXGE v1.60:
------------------------


Hi there PlayStation fan!
-------------------------

Thank you for using the PSXGameEdit program...

Many of you have probably used PSXGE for a while now, so I won't take your
time with a lot of writing here :)

I know that it's a damn long time since the last release and I've seemed
to lazy to get this version out. I'm really sorry, but starting on a real
job does take time. Bringing up a little kid also takes time, and wanting
to be a bit with the family also takes time, so there you go, a bad
excuse for not working enough on PSXGE. What the heck, here it is, go
try it and let me know what you think. It's still free, and it's for you
to use. Feel free to send donations though to encourage me to continue
coding and developing it (donations could include, but is not limited to,
a PocketStation, DVD movies, Postcards, money ;) You decide... )

What's new? Well...

- Hardware support for XPlorer/XPloder cartridges has been added,
  thanks to Tim Shuerewegen for the protocol!!
- Drag Drop support for both images and single game saves!
- Cmdline load of both images and single game saves!
- Doubleclick large icon for icon edit.
- Bleem compatibility check (WEB)
- XPlorer codes check (WEB)
- Some fixes...

... and a lot more I can't remember since it's a long time ago I coded it.

I'd still appreciate it very much if you would give me feedback on the 
program. What you like and dislike. How it works in your environment 
and if you have ideas, bug reports, convert succeses etc.

I'm sorry that I haven't finished a manual yet, but I'm working on a
help system which will be included in this millennium ;) (Yeah, right!) 
The program is quite self explanatory, but you may have to give it some
time to fully utilise all the possibilities...

Especially the convert-function can be a bit difficult to understand at
a first glance, but remember the 'convert' menu contains automatic
conversions and the 'set format' is for manually converting saves. 
'Set format' must ALWAYS be used in conjunction with editing the
Product Code!
